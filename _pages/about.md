I am a Machine Learning practitioner, Data Analyst, and Backend Web Developer from Nepal who loves bringing ideas to life. Currently, I am working as a Junior Deep Learning Researcher at [LBR](https://in.linkedin.com/company/learnbyresearch) and Data Science Fellow at [Code for Nepal](https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-for-nepal/about/).

Previously, I worked as a Lead Data Analyst and Machine Learning Developer during my fellowship at [Incubate Nepal](https://incubatenepal.com/).

Apart from Data Science and Machine Learning, I also have a keen interest in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) and have worked on HCI projects related to [Blind Assistance](https://github.com/dhaydoo/SeeingBox) and [Healthcare](https://projectsaas.info)).
