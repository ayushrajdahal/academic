I am a Machine Learning practitioner, Data Analyst, and Backend Web Developer from Nepal who loves bringing ideas to life. Currently, I am working as a Junior Deep Learning Researcher at <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/company/learnbyresearch" target="_blank">LBR</a> and Data Science Fellow at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-for-nepal/about/" target="_blank">Code for Nepal</a>.

Previously, I worked as a Data Science Lead and Machine Learning Developer during my fellowship at <a href="https://incubatenepal.com/" target="_blank">Incubate Nepal</a>.

Apart from Data Science and Machine Learning, I also have a keen interest in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) and have worked on HCI projects related to [Blind Assistance](https://ayushraj.com.np/portfolio/portfolio-1-seeingbox/) and [Healthcare](https://ayushraj.com.np/portfolio/portfolio-4-saas/)).
