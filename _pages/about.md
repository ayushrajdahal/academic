I am a Machine Learning practitioner, Data Analyst, and Backend Web Developer from Nepal who loves bringing ideas to life. I am currently a Data Science Fellow at [Code for Nepal](https://codefornepal.org/) and a Junior Deep Learning Researcher at [Learn by Research](https://in.linkedin.com/company/learnbyresearch).

Apart from Data Science and Machine Learning, I am also passionate about HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) and have worked on two HCI projects ([SeeingBox](https://github.com/dhaydoo/SeeingBox) and [Project Saas](https://projectsaas.info)) related to Blind Assistance and Healthcare respectively.

Previously, I have worked as a Lead Data Analyst and Machine Learning Developer during my fellowship at [Incubate Nepal](https://incubatenepal.com/), where I worked with Georgetown, Yale, and MIT graduates while contributing in the Data Science and Algorithm Development aspect of 3 projects ([Project Apravasi](https://www.instagram.com/p/CgnopvSoLP9/), [Project Sanjal](https://nsuman.github.io/SanzalWeb), and [Project Saas](https://projectsaas.info/)).
