I am a passionate Software Developer from Nepal specializing in Data Science.

Currently, I am a Data Science Fellow at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-for-nepal/about/" target="_blank">Code for Nepal</a>. Before this, I was working as an Algorithm Developer and Data Science Lead at <a href="https://incubatenepal.com/" target="_blank">Incubate Nepal</a> and a Junior Researcher at <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/company/learnbyresearch" target="_blank">LBR</a>.

Over the past year, I have been working on [Research](https://ayushraj.com.np/publications/) and [Software](https://ayushraj.com.np/portfolio/) projects where I was able to use Machine Learning to solve problems across multiple domains ranging from Economics, Fluid Flow Monitoring to HCI.
