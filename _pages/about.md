I am a passionate Software Developer specializing in Machine Learning.

I am currently a Data Science Fellow at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-for-nepal/about/" target="_blank">Code for Nepal</a>. Previously, I was working as a Research Scholar at <a href="https://incubatenepal.com/" target="_blank">Incubate Nepal</a> and Junior Researcher at <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/company/learnbyresearch" target="_blank">LBR</a>.

Over the past year, I have been working on [Research](https://ayushraj.com.np/publications/) and [Software](https://ayushraj.com.np/portfolio/) projects where I was able to apply my Programming skills to solve problems across multiple domains. I especially enjoyed working in the intersection of Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to build projects related to [Blind Assistance](https://ayushraj.com.np/portfolio/portfolio-1-seeingbox/) and [Healthcare](https://ayushraj.com.np/portfolio/portfolio-4-saas/).
