Hi there! Welcome to my website.

I am a passionate Software Developer from Nepal specializing in Data Science. Currently, I am a Data Science Fellow at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-for-nepal/about/" target="_blank">Code for Nepal</a>. Before this, I was an Algorithm Developer and Data Science Lead at <a href="https://incubatenepal.com/" target="_blank">Incubate Nepal</a> and Junior Researcher at <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/company/learnbyresearch" target="_blank">LBR</a>.

Over the past few years, I have worked on [Research](https://ayushraj.com.np/publications/) and [Software](https://ayushraj.com.np/portfolio/) projects where I used Machine Learning and Data Analysis to solve problems across domains ranging from Economics to HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). So, I made this website in an attempt to document some of them. 

If you'd like to learn more about my projects or have any crazy ML project idea that you'd like to bring to life, please let me know.
