Hi there!ðŸ‘‹

I am Ayush Raj Dahal, a passionate Software Developer from Nepal specializing in Data Science.

<!-- Currently, I am a Data Science Fellow at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/code-for-nepal/about/" target="_blank">Code for Nepal</a>. Before this, I was an Algorithm Developer and Data Science Lead at <a href="https://incubatenepal.com/" target="_blank">Incubate Nepal</a> and Junior Researcher at <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/company/learnbyresearch" target="_blank">LBR</a>. -->

Over the past few years, I have worked on [Research](https://ayushraj.com.np/publications/) and [Software](https://ayushraj.com.np/portfolio/) projects where I was able to use Machine Learning and Data Analysis to solve problems across domains ranging from Socioeconomics to HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). So, this website was my attempt to document some of them. 

If you'd like to learn more about me or my projects, or have any crazy project idea that you'd like to bring to life, please let me know!
